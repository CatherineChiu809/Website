            8/25/23 - On Monday we learned how to set up and access our websites. We learned some basic html codes to have a functioning website and were able to independently explore more commands to personalize our websites on Wednesday. Today, we went through a safety and engineering process slideshows which covered the importance of wearing safety equipment, how to handle supplies, and the steps in the engineering process. We also had our first challenge today. The goal of this challenge was to roll a marble from one pipe to another to a bucket. Our team won because we angled our pipes to have very slight slopes so that the marble rolled very slowly. This gave us time to pass down the pipes to the next person. We also started with our pipes pretty high up so that we had room to decline the pipe track so the marble could move forward.

            9/11/23 - The week of August 29th we started our first engineering unit, Mechanical Engineering. We learned that mechanical engineering is the oldest and broadest of the engineering fields. We started to tinkercad for the first time and had our tinkercad challenge. For this challenge, we made a household object out of basic shapes and the class voted on the winner. I made a mix master and was voted the best in my group. The week of September 3rd, we started and finished our cad designs for the mechanical engineering project. The project for this unit is a Rube Goldberg Machine made out of simple machines like pulleys and leavers. We started to cad our Rube Goldberg design which we decided to make out of pulleys, inclined planes, and leavers.

            9/21/23 - The week of September 11th, we started to create our cad design out of cardboard and tape. On Monday the 11th, we started by measuring and drawing out the heights for the columns, pulleys, levers, and tracks. Then on Wednesday, we started to cut out and attach the parts to the cardboard base. We ran into our first problem with the pulley. The single marble that we had planned to use did not weigh enough for the basket on the pulley to be pulled down. Also, the pulley kept getting caught on itself and would not move. We decided to add more marbles to increase the weight and made a pulley with the rope on an incline so it would move easier. This solved the pulley problem!! Sort of at least... The plan was to have the pulley lift a platform so that another marble would roll down the rest of the track and eventually cause the balloon to pop. The pulley still did not have enough force to hit the track hard enough to make the marble move. Instead, the marble hugged the wall that we made and got stuck each time. On Friday, we came up with a solution. We added a wedge to space the marble from the wall so it would be bumped off more easily. This helped the marble move and the problem was solved. Next on Monday the 18th, we needed to create the lever system that would pop the balloon, but the marble did not hit the lever with enough force to pop it. Therefore, we changed marble sizes and ramp inclines and then the marble hit hard enough. On Wednesday, we did our final tests and completed the project; finally!! Below we have the completed video and pictures of the process.

            9/29/23 - This week is the first week of computer engineering. On Friday the 22nd we went over the slides for the unit. We also did a challenge where we had to make a boat out of paper and it had to survive for 2 minutes in a tub of water. Whose boat could support the most weight would win. Our boat was made out of an origami balloon and easily survived the 2 minutes but we undercalculated how much weight the boat could support and we did not win. According to Mr. Kim, the best boat is a flat piece of paper because it has the most surface area and therefore floats the best, although his boat did sink when we tested it. In the end we decided that the flat piece of paper needed edges and the weight to be spread out so all the water would not flow to the middle of the boat. On Wednesday we did our lab for the unit which was dissecting, labeling, and putting back together a computer. We got to work in teams of two and we got two different screwdrivers and a container for screws. Taking apart the computer was easier than expected though putting it back together was a little more complicated. On Friday we filled out a worksheet where we had to label and color the parts of the computer. Below are the pictures from the dissection.

            10/6/23 - Last week was the first week of bioengineering. On Monday we went over the slides for the unit and learned that there are many subcategories of bioengineering. For example there is biomechanics which is about structure of the mechanical aspects of biological systems, genetic and tissue engineering which is about making Artificial Organs, DNA technology, and medical devices engineering, which makes medical devices for hospitals. For our lab this week we made a prosthetic hand out of cardboard, tape, and string. Our design had slightly cut creases for easily bending joints, string for ligaments and tendons, and tape to hold it all together. In the second design that is not pictured here, we threaded the strings through the back of the hand so they could be accessed more easily.

            9/20/23 - This week is the areospace engineering unit. We learned that there are two different branches of areospace engineering areonautics and astronautics. Areonautics is for things in flight inside of Earth's atmosphere and astronautics is for things in flight outside of Earth's atmosphere. For this unit we made bottle rockets made out of two liter bottles, cardboard, and paper. We made our water bottle rocket out of two bottles for an elongated shape, a nose cone for areodinamics, and fins for stablity. Unfortunately, when we tested, the rocket was too top heavy so it did not go very far and it flipped many times and ended up going backward. I learned that while having a rocket that is long and areodinamic is important, it is important to balance the weight as well.

            9/26/23 - We started the envernmental engineering unit this week. We learned about many of the things envernmental engineers can study like water filtration, global warming, water pollution, and light pollution. For the lab this week we made water filtration devices out of bottles, cotton balls, sand, and rocks. I learned that you should wash the rocks and sand because they already have a lot of dirt on them. Then you should have a filter that works slower and more effiently so you don't have to send it back through the filter many times. Our filter was made of three parts as to best clear the water. The top part had large rocks to stop the large chunks of dirt from going through, then some sand, medium rocks, more sand and cotton balls. We used the cotton balls to stop small holes we made in the cup to keep large particals out of the water. We then had two more half bottle with holes poked in the caps with sand, large rocks, medium rocks, and cotton balls which let out into a cup. The filtered water was light yellow, so a definite improvment. Below are the pictures of the filter and the difference between the dirty water and the clean water.

            11/8/2023 - The next few weeks are for the electical engineering unit. On Tuesday we went over the slides for the unit which included the difference between voltage, current, resistance, and power. We went on tinkecad in the circuit section on Thursday to do part one of labs one and two. Lab one was about making a basic circuit and lighting up an LED. Lab two went over the difference between circuits in series and circuits in parallel. Circuits in series evenly destributes voltage between all diodes while the voltage for circuits in parallel decreases after the diodes leaving each one duller than the next. On Tuesday we did part two of labs one and two where we made the cads of our circuits on actual breadboards with wires and LEDS.

        <li> The final score of the first bridge was 17.6 and the final score of the second bridge was 42.6.</li>
        <li> Most of the weight from both of our bridges came from the glue. </li>
        <li> The inspiration for our bridge came from researching types of bridges and what make them able to support a heavy load. We learned that crisscrossing triangles, thick structures, and tight features would hold our bridge up.  </li>
        <li> Our initial bridge did not work as well as we intended but, in retrospect, it makes sense because we made the bridge very thin which did not give it much support. Our second bridge preformed much better than we expected because after the first test we were not very confident. As it turns out, because we made the layered the spaghetti to make it taller and thicker and used less glue to make it more flexable, it was able to hold a lot more weight. </li>
        <li> The points of failure were in the same on both bridges. While we were expecting them at the middle, but the points of failure were actually directly next to where we were holding the bridge.</li>
        <li> To improve our bridge and prolong these point of failure, we could add extra flexablity and support to the weak areas of the bridge. </li>

        1/12/24 - We started chemical engineering today. We learned how the field of chemical engineering is different being a chemist. For example, chemical engineers make large scale projects that can then be marketed. For the lab this week we made oobleck. Oobleck is a non Newtonian fluid which means it does not follow Newton's laws of velocity. We had to figure out the large scale ratio of water to cornstarch to make it successfully. Below are pictures and videos of the lab.

        1/29/24 - This semester we are focusing on larger scale projects. The first one is an Arduino car that we have to build and program ourselves. This car is utilizes the fields of electrical engineering, programming, and materials engineering. We started by making a project proposal which included a BoM, project timeline, constranits, and more. Next we drew a 2D sketch of our design to scale where one box equals one centimeter and made a CAD as our 3D model. Finally, we started a CAD of the circuits to show which wires we have to connect and where. Below are the images of our CADs and sketch.

        3/4/24 - Last week we finished our arduino car project. Although we never got an ultrasonic distance sensor, we made a sequence of code that the car runs. Because we didn't have the sensor, we decided to focus more LEDS and wiring. To model a real car we made a light sequence including red tail lights that light up when the car goes backwards, and green headlights that blink when the car turns. We struggled a lot while wiring these because they frequently came undone. On the day of the final tests, our car stopped working. We were very confused because it had worked for the past week but just would not work then. We did not test that day, but on Monday we tested different parts of the car to see what part or parts weren't working. Apperently, the car had just enough battery to run the LED sequence, but not enough to power the motors. We solved this problem by replacing the battery. Another problem we ran into was with the wheels. We were only provided two wheels so we had to make two wheels out of cardboard. We struggled with wheels that would not inhibit the cards ability to turn as well as were able to suport the car's weight. We eventually made two wheels with two axels instead of both being on one. It didn't work great but it was the best design we came up with. To learn how to wire the car we watched a couple videos that ended up being very helpful. The coding was a lot easier than I expected it to be and soldering the wires was lots of fun. Overall, I learned to expect the unexpected, since we never expected our car to malfunction the day of the test. I also learned to be opened minded when going into the project. When we started, I was concerned about how hard it was going to be, but with the help of a few tutorials and Mr. Kim, it really wasn't to hard at all :). Below are the pictures and videos of our car.

        3/5/24 - This week marks the start of our final project of the quarter. For the next two weeks we are CADing, sketching, building, and testing our egg drop devices. When designing our CAD, we decided to focus on a few main elements. First, we wanted it to be light, second, we wanted it to have a wide bottom so it falls slower, third, we wanted it to have protection for the egg on the inside, and finally we wanted it to have a crumple layer to absorb some of the impact upon landing. With these goals in mind we sketched and CADed a device to protect an egg.

        3/12/24 - On Friday we tested our egg drop projects and our egg survived! We ended up changing our design a little bit. Instead of laying horizontal sheets of paper, we crumpled them into balls to so they would absorb the impact of the landing. This ended up working really well and was one of the main reasons the egg survived. Another was that the egg was very protected inside the box we designed for it with straws and cotton balls. Overall I learned that simple can better and it is important to think through your design before you start building. Below are the pictures and videos of the egg drop.

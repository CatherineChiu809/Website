            8/25/23 - Week One- On Monday we learned how to set up and access our websites. We learned some basic html codes to have a functioning website and were able to independantly expolore more commands to personalize our websites on Wendesday. Today, we went through a saftey and engineering process slideshows which covered importance of wearing saftey equipment, how to handle supplies, and the steps in the engineering process. We also had our first challenge today. The goal of this challenge was to roll a marble from one pipe to another all the way to a bucket. Our team won because we angled our pipes to have very slight slopes so that the marble rolled very slowly. This gave us time to pass down the pipes to the next person. We also started with our pipes pretty high up so that we had room to decline the the pipe track so the marble could move forward.

            9/11/23 - Week Two & Week Three - The week of August 29th we started our first engineering unit, Mechanical Engeering. We learned that mechanical engineering is the oldest and broadest of the engineering fields. We started to tinkeercad for the first time and had our tinkercad challenge. For this challenge we made a household object out of basic shapes and the class voted on the winner. I made mix master and was voted the best in my group. The week of September 3rd, we started and finished our cad designs for the mechanical engineering project. The project for this unit is a Rube Goldberg Machine made out of simple machines like pullies and leavers. We started to cad our Rube Goldberg design which we decided to make out of pullies, inclined planes, and leavers.

            9/21/23 - Week Four & Five - The week of September 11th, we started to create our cad design out of cardboard and tape. On Monday the 11th, we started by measuring and drawing out the hights for the columns, pully, levers, and tracks. Then on Wendesday, we started to cut out and attach the parts to the cardboard base. We ran into our first problem with the pully. The one marble that we had planned to use did not weigh enough for basket on the pully to be pulled down also the pully kept getting caught on itself and would not move. We decided to add more marbles to increase the weight and made a pully with the rope on an incline so it would move easier. This solved the pully problem!! Sort of at least... The plan was to have the pully lift a platform so that another marble would roll down the rest of the track and eventually cause the balloon to pop. The pully still did not have enough force to hit the track hard enough to make the marble move. Instead, the marble hugged the wall that we made and got stuck each time. On Friday, we came up with a sollution. We addded a wedge to space the marble from the wall so it would be bumped off easier. This helped the marble move and the problem was solved. Next on Monday the 18th, we needed to create the lever system that would pop the balloon, but the marble did not hit the leaver with enough force to pop it. Therefore, we changed marble sizes and ramp inclines and then the marble hit hard enough. On Wenesday, we did our final tests and completed the project; finally!! Below we have the completed video and pictures of the process.

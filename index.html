            8/25/23 - Week One- On Monday we learned how to set up and access our websites. We learned some basic html codes to have a functioning website and were able to independantly expolore more commands to personalize our websites on Wendesday. Today, we went through a saftey and engineering process slideshows which covered importance of wearing saftey equipment, how to handle supplies, and the steps in the engineering process. We also had our first challenge today. The goal of this challenge was to roll a marble from one pipe to another all the way to a bucket. Our team won because we angled our pipes to have very slight slopes so that the marble rolled very slowly. This gave us time to pass down the pipes to the next person. We also started with our pipes pretty high up so that we had room to decline the the pipe track so the marble could move forward.

            9/11/23 - Week Two & Week Three - The week of August 29th we started our first engineering unit, Mechanical Engeering. We learned that mechanical engineering is the oldest and broadest of the engineering fields. We started to tinkeercad for the first time and had our tinkercad challenge. For this challenge we made a household object out of basic shapes and the class voted on the winner. I made mix master and was voted the best in my group. The week of September 3rd, we started and finished our cad designs for the mechanical engineering project. The project for this unit is a Rube Goldberg Machine made out of simple machines like pullies and leavers. TO FINISH LATER!
